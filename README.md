# April STM32 Library

This library contains STM32F4xx device drivers.

The client must provide the stm32f4xx headers. 
These are typically generated by the STM Cube MX code generator.

This library should be directly included into your project.
This can be done by copying the files, using a symlink, or using a git submodule.
